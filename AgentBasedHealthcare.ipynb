            "G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) plays a prominent role in facilitating the rapid, non-genomic signaling of estrogens in breast cancer cells. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the role of GPER in ER-ɑ-negative breast cancer is provided. Activation of GPER affected proliferation, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition in ER-ɑ negative breast cancer cells. Clinical studies have demonstrated that GPER positivity was strongly correlated with larger tumor size and advanced clinical stage, suggesting that GPER/ERK signaling may play a role in promoting tumor progression. Strong evidence existed that environmental contaminants like bisphenol A have a carcinogenic potential mediated by GPER activation. The complexity of the cross talk between GPER and other receptors including ER-β, ER-α36, Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) and androgen receptor has been discussed. The potential utility of small molecules and phytoestrogens targeting GPER, adds valuable insights into its therapeutic potential. This review holds promises in advancing our understanding of GPER role in ER-ɑ-negative breast cancer. Overall, the consequences of GPER activation are still an area of active research and the implication are not entirely clear.\n",

TNBC symptoms may include: A new lump or mass. Swelling in all or part of a breast. Dimpled skin. Breast or nipple pain. Nipple retraction, when your nipple turns inward. Nipple or breast skin that's dry, flaking, thickened or red. A diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer means that the three most common types of receptors known to fuel most breast cancer growth-estrogen, progesterone, and the HER2/neu gene-are not present in the cancer tumor.. This means that the breast cancer cells have tested negative for hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PR). Susan G.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very heterogeneous and aggressive breast cancer subtype with a high risk of mortality, even if diagnosed early. The mainstay of early-stage breast cancer includes systemic chemotherapy and surgery, with or without radiation therapy. More recently, immunotherapy is approved to treat TNBC, but managing immune-rated adverse events while balancing efficacy ...\n",

            "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mFinal Answer: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that is different from other kinds because it does not have any of the three receptors commonly found in breast cancer: estrogen, progesterone, and HER2/neu. This means that treatments that target these receptors, like hormone therapy, are not effective against TNBC. It's called \"triple-negative\" because the cancer cells test negative for estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and HER2.\n",

            "For a 37-year-old woman newly diagnosed with TNBC, understanding this condition can be overwhelming. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Impact and Symptoms:** The symptoms of TNBC are similar to other types of breast cancer. They can include a new lump or mass in the breast, swelling of all or part of a breast, skin that is dimpled, pain in the breast or nipple, the nipple turning inward, or the skin of the nipple or breast becoming dry, flaking, thickened, or red. TNBC is known for being more aggressive and having a higher risk of recurrence, especially in the first 3-5 years after treatment. This can understandably cause anxiety and stress, but knowing the specifics of your condition helps in tackling it head-on with your healthcare team.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Treatment Options:** The main treatments for early-stage TNBC include surgery to remove the cancer (lumpectomy or mastectomy), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is often used because TNBC does not respond to hormone therapy or drugs that target HER2. Recently, immunotherapy has also become an option for some patients with TNBC, offering new hope for treatment. Your treatment plan will depend on the stage of your cancer, your overall health, and your preferences.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Prognosis:** The prognosis for TNBC can vary widely depending on several factors, including the stage at diagnosis and how well the cancer responds to treatment. While TNBC is more aggressive and has a higher risk of recurrence within the first 3-5 years after treatment, many women successfully complete treatment and go on to live healthy lives. It's important to focus on the steps you can take to treat your cancer and to work closely with your healthcare team to monitor your health.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Lifestyle Changes and Support:** After a diagnosis of TNBC, you may need to make some lifestyle changes, especially focusing on your overall health and well-being. Eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and finding ways to manage stress are important. Joining a support group, whether in-person or online, can provide valuable emotional support and information from others who understand what you're going through.\n",
